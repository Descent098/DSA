# Data Structures & Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms archive repository. Contains a bunch of implemented Data structures and Algorithms that I've encountered, with small write-ups to explain them. 

**PLEASE NOTE**

Some of these have better explanations than others, this is both a repo that is used for presentations and articles, those will have extensive resources poured into them, others are just reference implementations with minimal documentation for my own practice.

If you want to use any in a production environment **PLEASE VERIFY THEM YOURSELF**, I have not bothered to formally verify any of these, nor have I added exception handling, logging, etc.
